## General Information
- We will do a multiple linear regression on the dataset provided to understand independent variables which affect demand of shared bikes
- A US bike sharing company called BoomBikes had a dip in their revenue during the covid. So they have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- To model the demand for shared bikes with the independent variables provided, for management to understand how demand for bike varies with different features. 
- There is a dataset provided with columns like season, year, month, holiday, weekday, workingday, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed, casual, cnt 


## Conclusions
A .pynb file has been provided with all the details. The adjusted R squared in train dataset is 83% and on the test data is 79%.


## Technologies Used
Python, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodel
